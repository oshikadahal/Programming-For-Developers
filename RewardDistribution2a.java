Algorithm: Minimum Rewards Distribution

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - First, we initialize an array `rewards` of the same length as `ratings`, where every employee gets at least one reward initially.
   
2. **First Pass (Left to Right)**:
   - Traverse the ratings array from left to right.
   - If the current employee's rating is higher than the previous employee's rating, increment their reward by 1 compared to the previous employee's reward. This ensures that employees with higher ratings receive more rewards than their adjacent colleagues on the left.

3. **Second Pass (Right to Left)**:
   - After the first pass, traverse the ratings array from right to left.
   - If the current employee's rating is higher than the next employee's rating, ensure that the current employee gets a reward higher than the next employee's reward. We do this by updating their reward to be the maximum of the current reward and the next employeeâ€™s reward + 1. This ensures the "greater than adjacent" rule is maintained even in the reverse direction.

4. **Summing the Rewards**:
   - Finally, we sum up all the rewards in the `rewards` array to get the total number of rewards required.

5. **Time Complexity**:
   - **O(n)**: The algorithm performs two linear passes over the ratings array, where `n` is the number of employees. Each pass takes O(n) time.

6. **Space Complexity**:
   - **O(n)**: An additional array `rewards` of size `n` is used to store the rewards for each employee.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there is only one employee, the result is `1` reward, as every employee must receive at least one reward.
   - In case all ratings are the same, each employee would get one reward.

Example Explanation:
Example 1:
Input: ratings = [1, 0, 2]
Step-by-step:
- Initially, each employee gets one reward: [1, 1, 1]
- Left to right pass: [1, 1, 2] (Employee with rating 2 gets more than the previous one)
- Right to left pass: [2, 1, 2] (Employee with rating 1 remains with 1 reward, while the others remain correct)
- Final total rewards: 5

Example 2:
Input: ratings = [1, 2, 2]
Step-by-step:
- Initially: [1, 1, 1]
- Left to right pass: [1, 2, 1]
- Right to left pass: [1, 2, 1]
- Final total rewards: 4

The approach ensures that each employee gets at least one reward, and the rule of giving more rewards to employees with higher ratings than their adjacent colleagues is adhered to.
