/*
 * Problem given : Finding  the critical temperature 'f' with the minimum number of measurements.
  
  Given:
  - 'k': Number of identical samples.
  - 'n': Number of temperature levels.
  - If a sample breaks at temperature 'x', it cannot be reused.
  - If a sample does not break, it can be reused for further testing.
 
  Goal is to provide a way to:
  - Minimize the number of measurements required to determine 'f'.
 
 * Approach is to provide a way to calculate the number of measurement:
  - If k = 1, perform a linear search (worst case: 'n' measurements).
  - If k > 1, use dynamic programming:
    - Define dp[k][m] as the maximum number of temperature levels we can check.
    - Use the recurrence relation:
        dp[k][m] = dp[k-1][m-1] + dp[k][m-1] + 1
    - Increase 'm' until dp[k][m] >= n.
